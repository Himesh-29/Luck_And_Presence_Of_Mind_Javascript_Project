In this static webpage, two players are allowed to play a game, in which one of the player rolls a dice and the number on that dice adds up to his/her temporary storage. 
This process continues till the player rolls number 1 on the dice. This leads to termination of the player's turn and all his temporary storage is emptied.
So either he can add up his number to the permanent storage and pass the dice to the other player, or he rolls the dice again and again, and fills up his temprary storage until he rolls number 1 on dice.
Each number on the dice correspond to 1 point.
The game ends when either of the player reaches 100 points.
